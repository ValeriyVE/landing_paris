              <p>Layouts of apartments are designed to create entirely autonomous areas, even though walls in certain areas are absolutely absent, and therefore enhance the overall functionality of each individual space. In addition, large windows in every room provide plenty of natural sources of light and fill in the interiors with sunlight and life.</p>
